# hello-world

I'm a 17 year old ATE/ADE (Acdaemy for Technological/Digital Excellence) Student at a STEM/IB High School in Florida,
and I love making my own designs in Illustrator and Photoshop as well as writing code.

Currently, I am only comfortable in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and some Python. I am working on Ruby-on-rails and getting more
into back-end, server-side languages.
